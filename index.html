            <p>
                Peaky Blinders is a British period crime drama television series created by Steven Knight. Set in
                Birmingham, England, the series follows the exploits of the Shelby crime family in the direct aftermath
                of the First World War. The fictional family is loosely based on a real urban youth gang of the same
                name, who were active in the city from the 1890s to the early 20th century.
                Peaky Blinders features an ensemble cast, led by Cillian Murphy, Helen McCrory, Joe Cole and Paul
                Anderson starring as Tommy Shelby, Elizabeth "Polly" Gray, John Shelby and Arthur Shelby respectively,
                the gang's senior members. Sam Neill, Tom Hardy, Paddy Considine, Adrien Brody, Aidan Gillen, Charlotte
                Riley, Sam Claflin and Anya Taylor-Joy also have recurring roles at various junctures of the series. The
                show premiered on 12 September 2013, telecast on BBC Two until the fourth series, and then shifted to
                BBC One for the fifth series.
                In 2018, after the show's Drama Series win at the BAFTA TV Awards, Knight confirmed his <q>ambition of
                    making it a story of a family between two wars, and by ending it with the first air raid siren in
                    Birmingham</q> , which was 25 June 1940. The fifth series premiered on BBC One on 25 August 2019 and
                finished on 22 September 2019. Netflix, under the deal with Weinstein Company and Endemol, had acquired
                the rights to release Peaky Blinders in the United States and around the world. In January 2021, it was
                announced that the sixth series would be the final television series of Peaky Blinders.

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p>Peaky Blinders is an epic following a gangster family of Irish Traveller origin set in Birmingham,
                England, in 1919, several months after the end of the First World War in November 1918. The story
                centres on the Peaky Blinders gang and their ambitious and highly cunning boss Tommy Shelby (Cillian
                Murphy). The gang comes to the attention of Major Chester Campbell (Sam Neill), a Detective Chief
                Inspector in the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) sent over by Winston Churchill from Belfast, where
                he
                had been sent to clean up the city of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Communists, gangs and common
                criminals. Winston Churchill (played by Andy Nyman in Series 1 and Richard McCabe in Series 2)
                charged
                him with suppressing disorder and uprising in Birmingham and recovering a stolen cache of arms meant
                to
                be shipped to Libya. The first series concludes on 3 December 1919 – "Black Star Day", the event
                where
                the Peaky Blinders plan to take over Billy Kimber's betting pitches at the Worcester Races.

                The second series sees the Shelby family expand their criminal organisation in the <q>South and North
                    while maintaining a stronghold in their Birmingham heartland.</q> It begins in 1921 and ends with a
                climax
                at Epsom racecourse on 31 May 1922 – Derby Day.

                The third series starts and ends in 1924 as it follows Tommy and his family entering an even more
                dangerous world as they once again expand, this time internationally. The third series also features
                Father John Hughes (Paddy Considine), who is involved in an anti-communist organisation; Ruben
                Oliver
                (Alexander Siddig), a painter whom Polly enlists to paint her portrait; Russian Duchess Tatiana
                Petrovna
                (Gaite Jansen); and Linda Shelby (Kate Phillips), new wife of Arthur.

                The fourth series begins on Christmas Eve 1925 and ends following the general strike of May 1926
                with
                Tommy being elected as a Member of Parliament in 1927.

                The fifth series begins two years later on 29 October 1929 (Black Tuesday) and ends on 7 December
                1929,
                the morning after a rally led by fascist leader Oswald Mosley.

                    <p>Head of the Shelby gang, we find Tommy a shell of himself in series four. A year on from the
                        ‘deal’ which saw his family saved from the noose, the mobster is estranged from most of his
                        kin, living alone with his son Charlie after the death of wife Grace (Annabelle Wallis) at
                        the start of series three. But a new threat from Mafia boss Luca Changretty forces the
                        Shelbys to close ranks in a bid to preserve their very existence – and in their time of

            <h3>Series1</h3>
            <p>Peaky Blinders was created by Steven Knight, directed by Otto Bathurst, and produced by Katie
                Swinden.
                The writers are listed as Steven Knight, Stephen Russell and Toby Finlay.

                Screen Yorkshire provided funding for the production through the Yorkshire Content Fund, ensuring
                that
                the majority of the show was filmed in Yorkshire as part of the deal. The series was filmed in
                Birmingham, Bradford, Dudley, Leeds, Liverpool, and Port Sunlight. Railway sequences were filmed
                between
                Keighley and Damems, using carriages from the Ingrow Museum of Rail Travel (owned by Vintage
                Carriages
                Trust), and carriages owned by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Trust. Many of the scenes for
                the
                show were shot at the Black Country Living Museum.

                Ulster-born, New Zealand-raised Sam Neill enlisted the help of Northern Irish actors James Nesbitt
                and
                Liam Neeson to help him recover his lost Northern Irish accent for the role of C.I. Campbell. In the
                end, he had to tone down the accent since the series is being marketed in the United States.

                Controversially, the production did not hire linguists to assist in the show, leading to the
                Gypsies'
                frequently speaking broken Romanian (as opposed to Romani).

                        and
                        November 2014. On 11 January 2014, auditions were held in Digbeth area of Birmingham (near where
                        parts of the series are set) for white and mixed race teenage male extras, resulting in lengthy
                        queues.

                        which comprises six episodes. Filming for series 4 started in March 2017 and premiered on 15

                        2017 on BBC Two. The fourth series did not include The Weinstein Company or its logo in its
                        credits,

                would

                    <p>On 5 May 2018, Steven Knight told Birmingham Press Club that <q>we are definitely doing [series]
                            six
                            and

                            will probably do seven</q>. Knight has indicated that once the series is complete, a film or
                        spin-off could
                        follow. During 2020, rumors emerged linking comedian Rowan Atkinson to the show for the role of
                        Adolf
                        Hitler in Series 6, but the producers denied the involvement saying that the news is

                            false</q>.

                        On 18 January 2021, it was announced that series six, which had just begun filming, would be the
                        final
                        television series of Peaky Blinders; though Knight revealed <q>the story will continue in

            <h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
            <p>Peaky Blinders has received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, acting, visuals, and
                stylish
                cinematography. David Renshaw of The Guardian summarised the series as a
                <q>riveting, fast-paced tale of post-first world war Birmingham gangsters</q>
                , praising Murphy as the
                <q>ever-so-cool TommyShelby</q>
                and the
                rest of the cast for their
                <q>powerful performances.</q>
                Sarah Compton of The Telegraph gave the series a 4/5
                rating, praising the show for its originality and
                <q>taking all of our expectations and confounding them</q>
                .Alex Fletcher from Digital Spy believes that <q>Peaky Blinders has started as sharp as a dart,</q>
                while
                Den
                of Geek called the series <q>the most intelligent, stylish and engrossing BBC drama in ages.</q> Cult TV
                Times critic Hugh David said the show <q>warrants the billing</q> by <q>managing to tick several ratings
                    boxes
                    – period drama, gangster epic, film star leads – yet go against the grain of those in the most
                    interesting of ways.</q>

                The show has been particularly celebrated for its stylish cinematography and charismatic
                performances,
                as well as for casting an eye over a part of England and English history rarely explored on
                television.
                Historians have been divided over whether bringing characters and events from other decades into a
                1920s
                story undermines claims to historical accuracy, or whether working-class life in the period is
                nevertheless depicted in a truthful and resonant way. Reviews for the second series have remained
                positive, with Ellen E. Jones of The Independent commenting that <q>Peaky Blinders can now boast
                    several
                    more big-name actors to supplement the sterling work of Cillian Murphy, Helen McCrory and Sam
                    Neill</q>,
                referring to second series additions Tom Hardy and Noah Taylor.

                Several critics have favourably compared the show to the American series Boardwalk Empire, which
                shares
                the same themes and historical context. Show writer Steven Knight stated in an early interview: <q>Do
                    you
                    know – and I'm not just saying this – but I've never watched them. I've never seen The Wire, I've
                    never
                    seen Boardwalk Empire, I've never seen any of them.</q> When asked if he deliberately avoided
                watching
                these dramas, he responded: <q>It's sort of deliberate in that I don't really want to be looking at
                    other
                    people's work because it does affect what you do inevitably.</q> On 2 March 2016, Knight told the
                Crime
                Scene Quarterly <q>I've had unsolicited communication from Michael Mann, the film director, from
                    Dennis
                    Lehane, Snoop Dogg – he's such a fan. And the late David Bowie was a huge fan – more of that to
                    come</q>
                (strongly hinting Bowie's involvement on Series 3). It was later confirmed that David Bowie's music
                would be featured, and Leonard Cohen had also written a new song for series 3.

                    <p>In August 2020, a video game based on the television series was developed by Curve Digital and
                        released
                        for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and for home computers via Steam. Designed as a
                        puzzle
                        adventure game, the title acts as a prequel to the events of the series, set just before the
                        premiere of
                        the first season, and focused on the rise of Tommy Shelby to become the leader of the Shelby
                        Family,
                        as
                        he attempts to thwart an effort to prevent someone wiping out the gang. The game received
                        positive
                        feedback from critics for embracing the television series' setting and characters, and adding a
                        unique
                        twist to puzzle solving.
